# boggle
A small boggle game 


This program is based off the classic game of boggle. You can search in multiple directions for word. When entering a word that is not found, the program will prompt "found word in not found list: " meaning that the word is not already in the list of words found. You can type a word to find, or use "auto" to find all the words for you. The command "print" will print all of the words in the list that have been found (including those found automatically). To quit the game, type "quit". A file, Boggle.txt, will be generated with a depiction of the board, the words found, and the amount of points the user has found. 



## Points: 

If the word is less than 4 letters, then you are awarded 1 point. If the word is equal to 5 letters, you get 2 points. If the word is 6 letters, 3 points. 7 letters gets you 5 points, and if the word is greater than 7 letters, you get 11 points. This is based off of the classic boggle scoring system.
